### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name's Leonardo, I'm a computer engineering student. Passionate about software development.

<!--
**âš¡ Iâ€™m currently looking for an intern. --> 

:notebook_with_decorative_cover: Iâ€™m currently learning : Java, Python, C#

### Cover Letter
I use to define myself as a proactive person and well-humored. I stand out at the learning process and at the ability
to keep calm during stressful and tough situations. I have basic knowledge about the program's languages such as
Python, Java, and Dart-Flutter. However, even though I'm a person with ease with exact science,
I have no difficulty dealing with activities related to other knowledge areas.
